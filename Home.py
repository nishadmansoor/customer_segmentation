st.write("The goal of our project is to identify segments of customers so that we can create personalized marketing strategies that will ultimately improve customer retention. To do this, we conducted an RFM analysis and used the scores to calculate Customer Lifetime Value. Using the RFM scores and CLV values, we segmented customers based on attributes like value, behavior, potential, etc. We utilized clustering techniques to group customers that have similar characteristics.")
